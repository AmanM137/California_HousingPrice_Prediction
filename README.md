# California Housing Price Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting housing prices in California. The model is built using Python, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow, and it serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project provides information about houses in various California districts based on the 1990 census data.

### About Dataset:
The dataset includes a list of variables related to the houses found in a given California district, along with some summary statistics. It's important to note that the data require preprocessing steps due to potential issues with cleanliness. The project will guide you through the necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning model.
